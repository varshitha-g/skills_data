# skills_data
Task:

you need to add an extra column designation

and based on student skills you have to find a particular student is suitable for machine learning developer designation or web developer

I have provided a list of machine learning skills and web developer skills

if the student has more than or equal to 3 skills of machine learning or web development then assign his/her designation according to skills

at the end of the row, you also need to total the number of skills

and then convert your result into an excel file

Note:
There is one twist that I have added to finding the designation of student
